## Introduction

The **Facial Expression-Based Lie Detection System** is an advanced computer vision project designed to detect and analyze facial expressions, blink rates, gaze directions, emotions, and even subject's hand gestures, such as touching their face. It is used to determine whether a person is lying or being truthful. This system leverages various techniques, including face detection, emotion analysis, and gaze tracking, to provide valuable insights for interrogators and investigators.

## Features

- **Blink Rate Analysis:** Calculates the blink rate in real-time and provides feedback on eye blink patterns.
- **Gaze Direction Tracking:** Tracks the direction of a person's gaze, aiding in assessing their focus and attention.
- **Emotion Analysis:** Utilizes emotion detection to identify the dominant emotion displayed by the person.
- **Hand Gesture Detection:** Detects hand gestures, such as touching the face, providing additional behavioral cues for analysis.


## Demo

**Real-time Detection**

1. Once the system is running, it will analyze the webcam feed in real-time.
2. Detected behaviors will be highlighted directly on the webcam feed.

**Customization (Optional)**

1. If desired, customize detection thresholds for each behavior:
2. Modify the settings in the configuration file.

**Observation and Assessment**

1. Observe the detected behaviors on the webcam feed.
2. Assess the likelihood of the person lying or being truthful based on displayed cues.

**Feedback and Issues**

If you encounter any issues, have questions, or want to provide feedback, please open an issue in the repository. We value your input and will work together to address any concerns.
